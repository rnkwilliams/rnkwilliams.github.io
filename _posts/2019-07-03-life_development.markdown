Learning software development so far has been both a challenge and rewarding experience. I’m a few weeks shy of my first 90 days and have learned so much! I’m currently working on Object Oriented Ruby -Metaprogramming and on the home stretch on starting my first portfolio project/final project for the section. I have to say that I'm excited and a bit nervous as to what to expect from the final project, but I'm confident that I will have the necessary support to help me through if and when I get stuck. 

Working full-time, being a mother, and wife has definitely taught me balance and this balance thing has helped me tremendously with staying on track with the curriculum. I think that finding that balance is crucial as things in life always happen unexpectedly and its like the more hats of responsibilities being worn the higher the chances of getting side-tracked or de-railed from your goals. (Shout out to being an adult, adult life is real!)

Nevertheless, I’m continuing to stay focused, gaining the knowledge and understanding of what is being taught, and I have my eye on the prize at the end of it all. Wish me luck!
