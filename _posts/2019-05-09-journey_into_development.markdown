Before I dive into how and why I chose to start learning to code, I would like to step back and give you a little insight into to the process which started everything. Being in the healthcare field for over 8 years, I've come to realize that I needed a change of pace when it came to my career. Dont get me wrong, I learned alot working in healthcare and met some amazing people while mastering my professional skills but I needed something new something that would challenge me. I've always been an advocate for creating and learning new things, but I knew that I needed something that would take both of those qualities and turn it into a career that I would truly enjoy: software development.

I started this adventurous journey into coding, about a year ago wondering where to start and how. Deciding on taking the self-taught route, I began using free online resources to get the feel for code and later began using paid online resources for a deeper dive into HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Next thing I know, I began listening to different podcasts as I got ready for work, driving into work, and coming home from work! That is how I stumbled upon the Flatiron School Software Development Bootcamp.

One month in and I've already learned so much from the Ruby programming language alone. Learning a new programming language is by far the most challenging but yet rewarding thing that I've ever done. Just like learning to play an instrument or learning a new language, it requires tons of practice to become really good at it and when I am able to solve a problem it's a major accomplishment.
