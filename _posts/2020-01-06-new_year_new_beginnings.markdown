I’m currently a little more than half way through the self-paced software engineering course and it has been a very interesting and exciting journey! I have adopted a new style of learning, learned how to manage my time wisely (while working a full-time job and being a mom) and keeping myself motivated during the difficult times of self doubt. 

As stated previously I started the course working a full-time job and even though is VERY possible to do, it is also very challenging trying to juggle studying and completing my projects in a timely matter along with life’s everyday responsibilities. Just recently I have been able to quit my job to focus full-time on completing the rest of program (shout out to my husband for his amazing support) and I’m super excited! This marks a new transition for me at the start of the year which allows me to tune in, re-focus on my goals and to dive even deeper into my learning full-time. Learning or starting something new in general can be a very scary and nerve wrecking experience as you’re constantly unsure of the outcome, but staying positive and trusting the process really helps to keep pushing forward to crushing my goals.
